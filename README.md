## About Me

Hi! I'm Kerem Yalçın, a passionate web developer focused on building clean and responsive websites using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. I love learning new technologies and improving my skills every day.

Currently, I'm working on personal projects to strengthen my coding abilities and aiming to contribute to open-source communities.

Feel free to check out my projects and get in touch!

## 📰 WordPress & CMS

I also have experience using **WordPress** to build custom websites locally via **XAMPP**. I’ve worked on customizing themes, adding plugins, and modifying layout components. 

Although I don't currently host my WordPress projects online, I can provide code samples or walkthrough videos upon request.
